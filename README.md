# Project Backlog and Checklist

## Sprint Backlog

### 1. Project Setup
- **Create C#.NET server-side web app**
  - Create a new C#.NET project.
  - Configure the project to run on a Linux setup.
- **Configure SSL Certificate**
  - Integrate the company's SSL certificate into the application to ensure HTTPS communication.

### 2. Core Functionality Development
- **User Registration**
  - Implement user registration with 2-factor authentication.
  - Store user registration information in a database.
- **User Login**
  - Implement login functionality with strong password requirements.
  - Integrate 2-factor authentication for login.
- **Simple File Creation**
  - Implement functionality to create a simple text file on the server.

### 3. Security Measures
- **Strong Password Requirements**
  - Define and implement strong password requirements (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
- **Database Security**
  - Ensure secure storage of user information in the database (e.g., using hashing and salting of passwords).
- **Two-Factor Authentication**
  - Implement and test two-factor authentication for both registration and login.

### 4. Testing
- **Unit Tests**
  - Develop unit tests for core functionalities (user registration, login, file creation).
- **Non-functional Tests**
  - Perform cross-platform compatibility tests to ensure the application works across different operating systems and browsers.
  - Test the application's security (e.g., via penetration tests, vulnerability scans).
